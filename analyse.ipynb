The goal of the study is to assess the impact of playing at home considering the presence of supporters in a football stadium.

    "\\\n",
    "To analyze the data, the following methods were used : \n",
    "- The **Wilcoxon signed-rank test** : a non-parametric test used to compare two paired sets of values, often before and after a treatment. The aim is to determine whether the two measurements are significantly different without assuming a specific distribution for the differences. From this test, the **p-value** is derived (the probability of observing results as extreme as those in the sample, under the null hypothesis that there is no effect or difference. If the p-value is small (<0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating an effect).\n",
    "- The **Cohen's d** : a measure of effect size, used to determine if an observed difference between two groups is practically significant, beyond just statistical significance.\n",
    "- The **Mann-Whitney U test** : a non-parametric test used to compare two independent groups to assess whether their distributions differ significantly."
