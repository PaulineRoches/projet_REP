The goal of the study is to assess the impact of playing at home considering the presence of supporters in a football stadium. The initial hypothesis is that their presence has a positive effect on team performance, both in terms of points and goals scored, as well as in relation to expected points and goals.\\\n",

    "To analyze the data, the following methods were used : \n",
    "- The **Wilcoxon signed-rank test** : a non-parametric test used to compare two paired sets of values, often before and after a treatment. The aim is to determine whether the two measurements are significantly different without assuming a specific distribution for the differences. From this test, the **p-value** is derived (the probability of observing results as extreme as those in the sample, under the null hypothesis that there is no effect or difference. If the p-value is small (<0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating an effect).\n",
    "- The **Cohen's d** : a measure of effect size, used to determine if an observed difference between two groups is practically significant, beyond just statistical significance.\n",
    "- The **Mann-Whitney U test** : a non-parametric test used to compare two independent groups to assess whether their distributions differ significantly."

    "\n",
    "The results of the ANOVA across several major European football leagues from 2014 to 2020 reveal important insights into the home advantage and its variability over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ligue 1:**\n",
    "Most seasons show statistically significant differences between home and away performances (p-value < 0.05). However, the 2020 season is an outlier with a p-value of 0.9529, indicating no significant difference. This suggests that home advantage was negligible in 2020, likely due to the absence of spectators caused by the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **La Liga:**\n",
    "Every season exhibits significant differences, with all p-values below 0.05, suggesting a consistent home advantage. Even in 2020, despite pandemic-related disruptions, the differences remained significant, implying that home advantage persisted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **EPL:**\n",
    "All seasons except 2020 show significant differences. The 2020 season has a p-value of 0.6022, indicating no significant difference. This suggests the pandemic had a strong impact, reducing the home advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bundesliga:**\n",
    "Significant differences are observed in all seasons except for 2019 and 2020, with p-values of 0.6049 and 0.0276 respectively. The lack of significance in 2019 suggests variability even before the pandemic, while 2020 results highlight the pandemic's effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Serie A:**\n",
    "Significant differences are found in all seasons except 2019 (p = 0.2219) and 2020 (p = 0.1086). This indicates that home advantage was not significant in these years, especially during the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RFPL:**\n",
    "Several seasons, including 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020, show no significant differences. This variability suggests that the home advantage fluctuated, with the pandemic further diminishing it in 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion with that new statistical method :\n",
    "The analysis demonstrates that the impact of COVID-19 on home advantage was not uniform across all leagues. Some leagues, like La Liga, maintained significant differences even during the pandemic. However, others, such as Serie A, RFPL, and the Bundesliga, exhibited a clear reduction in home advantage in 2020. The data indicates that COVID-19 had a substantial impact on football matches in 2020, neutralizing the traditional home advantage in several cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the new findings largely support the previous conclusion that home advantage diminished during the COVID-19 seasons, they also introduce the same important nuances that in the wilcoxon study of Mathieu Acher's work. The first observation suggested a general trend of reduced home advantage across the board, but the current analysis reveals that this was not uniformly the case for all leagues. For example, La Liga maintained significant differences in home and away performances even in 2020, suggesting that the impact of the pandemic on home advantage was not as pronounced there. This nuanced view indicates that while the pandemic did influence home advantage in many leagues, the extent of its impact varied, highlighting league-specific factors and suggesting that the generalization of diminished home advantage might need reconsideration. As Mathieu Acher's work says, \"statistical results show that the COVID period had variable effect\" within the leagues."

    "By adding the data from the 2021, 2022, and 2023 seasons, we observe some new insights about the differences in points and expected points (xPoints) between home and away matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ligue 1, after the notable dip in home advantage during the 2020 season, where there was a negative difference in points (-3), the next seasons show a partial recovery. While the 2021 and 2022 seasons reflect the same 'diff points' than before Covid (if somewhat a bit lower : 138 and 114 points, respectively), in 2023, there is a notable lower difference between points scored at home vs away with only 45 points. However, the 'diff xPoints' of that season is as high as pre-Covid seasons which suggests that the impact on the performances of footballers is not only dependant on if they play with or without spectators. \n",
    "\n",
    "La Liga presents a more robust \"recovery\" but we have to take into account that the Covid did not completly change their performances : even though the advantage of playing at home was slightly less significant in season 2020 (135 points), the advantage was still there. The difference in points remains relatively stable from 2021 to 2023, with values ranging from 183 to 219 points. This indicates that the home advantage, has well recovered after season 2020, nearing or surpassing pre-pandemic figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the English Premier League (EPL), the 2020 season exhibited a sharp decline in home advantage with a negative difference of -27 points, a stark contrast to other leagues. However, in 2021, the difference in points improves significantly to 102, and by 2022 and 2023, the differences further increase to 225 and 156 points, respectively. This suggests a strong rebound in home advantage post-pandemic, the situation becomes as it was pre-pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Bundesliga, the recovery appears steady. After the decline in 2020 (99 points), the difference in points increases consistently, reaching 159 in 2021 and 177 in 2022, before slightly dropping to 129 in 2023. \n",
    "\n",
    "Serie A shows a more gradual recovery. The difference in points continues to remain lower than the pre-pandemic period, with 42 points in 2021. However, there are 126 points in 2022 and, by 2023, the figure climbs to 150 points. That indicates a slow but steady return of home advantage, though still not matching earlier years' levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the Russian Premier League (RFPL) exhibits fluctuations. After the minimal difference in 2019 (-3 points) and a slight recovery in 2020 (126 points), the following seasons maintain moderate differences, with 81 points in 2021, 123 in 2022, and 156 in 2023. This pattern suggests a relatively stable but moderate home advantage post-pandemic. It ends by being even stronger than before Covid-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this suggests a gradual restoration of home advantage, although it hasn't yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the extended dataset from the 2021 to 2023 seasons provides a nuanced view of the home advantage in football across different leagues post-COVID-19. While some leagues like La Liga, the EPL and the Bundesliga demonstrate a strong and swift recovery in home advantage, returning to or even surpassing pre-pandemic levels, others such as Ligue 1 and Serie A show a more gradual or incomplete rebound. The RFPL, on the other hand, exhibits fluctuations but ultimately suggests a strengthening of home advantage compared to pre-pandemic times."

Surprisingly, 2023 also shows significant results for Wilcoxon, suggesting that the hypothesis of home advantage is not verified even with the return of spectators. This season seems to be an exception as we did not observed the same results in 2021 and 2022 but this points to the possibility that other factors, such as changes in team tactics or shifts in crowd dynamics, influenced the outcomes in 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **EPL:**\n",
    "Significant results in 2020 for both Cohen’s d and Wilcoxon p-values confirm a reduction in home advantage during the pandemic. However, no significant results are observed for 2023, suggesting a return to more balanced conditions and the re-establishment of home advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **La Liga:**\n",
    "Consistent lack of significant results across all seasons indicates that home advantage remained stable throughout the studied period, even during the COVID-19 era. This suggests that crowd presence or absence had minimal impact on performance in this league.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Bundesliga:**\n",
    "Significant results in 2019 for both Cohen’s d and Wilcoxon p-values highlight disruptions to home advantage during the hybrid 2019-2020 season. However, the absence of significant results for next seasons, including 2020, suggests that the home advantage is indeed due to spectators.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Serie A:**\n",
    "Significant results in multiple seasons (2017, 2019, 2020, 2021) for points indicate consistent disruptions to home advantage, extending beyond the COVID-19 period. The lack of significant xPoints or xG results implies that these disruptions are likely due to league-specific dynamics rather than the absence of spectators.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **RFPL:**\n",
    "Significant results for points in 2015, 2017, and 2019 highlight variability in home advantage that predates the COVID-19 pandemic. The absence of significant results in subsequent seasons suggests that the pandemic and the return of spectators had little to no effect on the league’s home advantage dynamics.\n",

    "**Comparison with Previous Results (2014–2020)**\n",

    "- In **EPL**, results from 2020 and following seasons reaffirm the conclusions of the study: home advantage was disrupted during the COVID-19 period and is back to normal after the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **Ligue 1**, the results from 2020, 2021 and 2022 confirm the hypothesis : home advantage was interrupted during Covid and is then back. However, the significant results for 2023 in Ligue 1 contrast with expectations, as home advantage is still not observed despite the return of spectators. This challenges the notion that crowd presence alone dictates home advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For **Bundesliga**, the results are consistent with the earlier conclusions. The disruption observed in 2019 aligns with the hybrid nature of the season, while next seasons indicate a return to normal dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **La Liga** continues to exhibit stability in home advantage, confirming prior observations that the league is less affected by external factors like crowd dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Serie A** and **RFPL** maintain patterns of variability in home advantage across seasons, which aligns with previous findings. These results suggest that the pandemic had a limited impact on home advantage in these leagues, with disruptions more likely attributable to other league-specific factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications for Home Advantage and the Role of Spectators**\n",
    "\n",
    "The extended dataset through 2023 provides critical insights into the dynamics of home advantage. While leagues like EPL and Bundesliga seem to have reverted to pre-pandemic dynamics, Ligue 1’s significant results for 2023 indicate that home advantage is still not fully re-established, even with spectators present. This could suggest that the influence of crowds may vary not only by league but also by season. The disruption of home advantage during the COVID-19 period in leagues like Ligue 1 and EPL supports the hypothesis that crowd presence plays a significant role. However, the lack of significant results for La Liga and the continued variability in Serie A and RFPL suggest that other factors—such as tactics, travel conditions, fan behavior or psychological influences—also contribute significantly to home advantage.\n"

    "    - The lack of significant differences between 2021 and the pre-COVID seasons (2014-2019) indicates a return to normal levels of home advantage starting in 2021. This suggests that the disruptions of 2020 did not have lasting effects on the long-term trend.\n",

However, the difference with 2020 reinforces the notion that 2023 is not part of the COVID-induced anomaly and differences with 2015, 2018, and 2019 may point to evolving factors, such as tactical changes, improved away team preparation, or other external influences.\n",

    "In the original analysis, the use of one-sided tests allowed us to specifically test for a directional effect—whether home advantage was significantly reduced during the COVID-19 period. This approach aligns closely with the hypothesis under investigation and provides more precise results regarding the impact of the pandemic on home advantage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, with the updated version of SciPy requiring two-sided tests, the analysis now assesses whether there is any difference (in either direction) between the distributions being compared, rather than focusing on a specific direction of change. As a result, the statistical power to detect directional effects is reduced, and in some cases, we do not reach the same conclusions as with the one-sided test. This limitation could obscure subtle directional effects, such as the reduction in home advantage, which were previously detectable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results of the Analysis\n",
    "If this analysis were conducted as a standalone study, the results would suggest the following:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bundesliga:**  \n",
    "The lack of significant p-values for comparisons between 2019 and earlier seasons (2014, 2016, and 2018) implies that the disruptions to home advantage observed in 2019 may not be as strong as hypothesized. However, significant comparisons involving 2020 remain, indicating that the COVID-19 season had a measurable impact, likely due to the absence of fans in stadiums.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **EPL:**  \n",
    "The absence of significant results for 2019 vs. 2014, 2020 vs. 2015, and 2020 vs. 2019 suggests a more variable effect of the pandemic. While home advantage disruptions in 2020 are evident in comparisons with earlier seasons (e.g., 2014–2018), the results point to inconsistencies in how the home advantage was affected across seasons.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **La Liga:**  \n",
    "The non-significant results for 2020 vs. 2015 and 2020 vs. 2019 suggest that La Liga's home advantage remained relatively stable during the COVID-19 period. These findings reinforce the idea that this league was less influenced by the absence of fans compared to others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ligue 1:**  \n",
    "Significant results remain consistent across comparisons, indicating that home advantage was clearly disrupted during the COVID-19 period. This league shows the most robust evidence for a pandemic-related effect on home performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **RFPL:**  \n",
    "No significant differences were observed, suggesting that home advantage in the Russian Premier League was not meaningfully affected during the COVID-19 period. This aligns with findings that this league exhibits less variability in home advantage across seasons.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Serie A:**  \n",
    "The lack of significant results for 2020 vs. 2015 and 2020 vs. 2016 suggests that the disruptions to home advantage in 2020 were not uniformly observed across all comparisons. Nevertheless, significant results for comparisons with other seasons (e.g., 2017–2019) indicate that the impact of the pandemic was still present, though less pronounced.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison with the One-Sided Test Results\n",
    "When compared to the original study that used one-sided tests, several differences emerge:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- For **Bundesliga**, the previously significant results for 2019 vs. 2014, 2019 vs. 2016, and 2019 vs. 2018 are now non-significant, weakening the evidence that the hybrid 2019 season disrupted home advantage. However, the significant results for 2020 remain, consistent with the original conclusion that COVID-19 impacted home advantage in that season.  \n",
    "- For **EPL**, the loss of significance for 2019 vs. 2014, 2020 vs. 2015, and 2020 vs. 2019 diminishes the strength of conclusions about disruptions to home advantage in 2019 and parts of 2020. This suggests that the evidence for a COVID-19 effect is less consistent under two-sided tests.  \n",
    "- In **La Liga**, the non-significant results for 2020 vs. 2015 and 2020 vs. 2019 reinforce the idea that home advantage was not disrupted, aligning with the conclusions of the previous statistical tests.  \n",
    "- For **Ligue 1** and **RFPL**, the results remain consistent with the one-sided tests, suggesting that the conclusions drawn in the original study are robust for these leagues.  \n",
    "- In **Serie A**, the new non-significant results for 2020 vs. 2015 and 2020 vs. 2016 suggest a reduced impact of COVID-19 on home advantage in those comparisons, though significant results for other seasons still support the presence of disruptions during the pandemic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The shift from one-sided to two-sided tests reveals that some previously identified effects might be more nuanced or less robust than initially thought.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion for another version of SciPy\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis highlights the sensitivity of the study’s conclusions to the choice of statistical method. The original study, which relied on one-sided tests, was more aligned with the directional hypothesis (a reduction in home advantage during COVID-19). The use of two-sided tests introduces additional scrutiny by testing for deviations in both directions, leading to differences in significance for some season comparisons.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the replicability of the study, this indicates:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency of Results:** The differences observed here suggest that conclusions about the impact of COVID-19 on home advantage may vary depending on the statistical approach used. While many findings remain consistent (e.g., Ligue 1, RFPL), the variability in other leagues (e.g., Bundesliga, EPL, Serie A) underscores the importance of methodological consistency for replicability.  \n",
    "- **Reevaluation of Findings:** The results from two-sided tests indicate that some effects initially observed might not be as robust as previously thought. This necessitates caution in generalizing findings and emphasizes the need for replication with different statistical methods to validate conclusions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while the original conclusions remain valid in many cases, the differences highlighted here demonstrate that methodological choices significantly influence outcomes. This methodological change highlights the importance of consistent statistical tools in longitudinal studies and underlines how updates to software packages can influence the replicability of results and conclusions. Care must be taken to adapt hypotheses and interpretations to the constraints imposed by the new testing methods."

    "Through the replication of the study, we've been able to improve the quality of our analysis by testing different changes to the protocol. Our findings reinforce the initial hypothesis: in general, the presence of supporters has a significant impact on team performance. The methods we applied provided clearer evidence that  during the unique circumstances of the pandemic, where we had no supporters, the home advantage was lower than usual. It shows that this advantage is strongly influenced by whether or not fans are in the stadium.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, there’s still room to explore other methods that could further enhance our understanding. For instance, using a different dataset might help confirm if the results hold up across other leagues or periods. Another promising avenue could be shifting the focus of our statistical tests from individual matches to team-level performance. This might reveal new patterns or insights about how specific teams adapt to changes in crowd presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while this replication effort has successfully confirmed key findings and improved the analysis, it also highlights opportunities for further research. Testing additional methods could provide even deeper insights into the role that supporters play in influencing game outcomes, making this a valuable area for ongoing investigation."
