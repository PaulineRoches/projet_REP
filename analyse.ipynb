    "To analyze the data, the following methods were used : \n",
    "- The **Wilcoxon signed-rank test** : a non-parametric test used to compare two paired sets of values, often before and after a treatment. The aim is to determine whether the two measurements are significantly different without assuming a specific distribution for the differences. From this test, the **p-value** is derived (the probability of observing results as extreme as those in the sample, under the null hypothesis that there is no effect or difference. If the p-value is small (<0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating an effect).\n",
    "- The **Cohen's d** : a measure of effect size, used to determine if an observed difference between two groups is practically significant, beyond just statistical significance.\n",
    "- The **Mann-Whitney U test** : a non-parametric test used to compare two independent groups to assess whether their distributions differ significantly."

    "\n",
    "The results of the ANOVA across several major European football leagues from 2014 to 2020 reveal important insights into the home advantage and its variability over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ligue 1:\n",
    "Most seasons show statistically significant differences between home and away performances (p-value < 0.05). However, the 2020 season is an outlier with a p-value of 0.9529, indicating no significant difference. This suggests that home advantage was negligible in 2020, likely due to the absence of spectators caused by the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- La Liga:\n",
    "Every season exhibits significant differences, with all p-values below 0.05, suggesting a consistent home advantage. Even in 2020, despite pandemic-related disruptions, the differences remained significant, implying that home advantage persisted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- EPL:\n",
    "All seasons except 2020 show significant differences. The 2020 season has a p-value of 0.6022, indicating no significant difference. This suggests the pandemic had a strong impact, reducing the home advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bundesliga:\n",
    "Significant differences are observed in all seasons except for 2019 and 2020, with p-values of 0.6049 and 0.0276 respectively. The lack of significance in 2019 suggests variability even before the pandemic, while 2020 results highlight the pandemic's effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Serie A:\n",
    "Significant differences are found in all seasons except 2019 (p = 0.2219) and 2020 (p = 0.1086). This indicates that home advantage was not significant in these years, especially during the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- RFPL:\n",
    "Several seasons, including 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020, show no significant differences. This variability suggests that the home advantage fluctuated, with the pandemic further diminishing it in 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion with that new statistical method :\n",
    "The analysis demonstrates that the impact of COVID-19 on home advantage was not uniform across all leagues. Some leagues, like La Liga, maintained significant differences even during the pandemic. However, others, such as Serie A, RFPL, and the Bundesliga, exhibited a clear reduction in home advantage in 2020. The presence of non-significant results in 2019 for some leagues suggests that home advantage can vary for reasons beyond the pandemic. Nevertheless, the data indicates that COVID-19 had a substantial impact on football matches in 2020, neutralizing the traditional home advantage in several cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the new findings largely support the previous conclusion that home advantage diminished during the COVID-19 seasons, they also introduce the same important nuances that in the wilcoxon study of Mathieu Acher's work. The first observation suggested a general trend of reduced home advantage across the board, but the current analysis reveals that this was not uniformly the case for all leagues. For example, La Liga maintained significant differences in home and away performances even in 2020, suggesting that the impact of the pandemic on home advantage was not as pronounced there. This nuanced view indicates that while the pandemic did influence home advantage in many leagues, the extent of its impact varied, highlighting league-specific factors and suggesting that the generalization of diminished home advantage might need reconsideration. As Mathieu Acher's work says, \"statistical results show that the COVID period had variable effect\" within the leagues."

However, significant comparisons involving 2020 remain, indicating that the COVID-19 season had a measurable impact, likely due to the absence of fans in stadiums.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **EPL:**  \n",
    "The absence of significant results for 2019 vs. 2014, 2020 vs. 2015, and 2020 vs. 2019 suggests a more variable effect of the pandemic. While home advantage disruptions in 2020 are evident in comparisons with earlier seasons (e.g., 2014–2018), the results point to inconsistencies in how the home advantage was affected across seasons.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **La Liga:**  \n",
    "The non-significant results for 2020 vs. 2015 and 2020 vs. 2019 suggest that La Liga's home advantage remained relatively stable during the COVID-19 period. These findings reinforce the idea that this league was less influenced by the absence of fans compared to others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ligue 1:**  \n",
    "Significant results remain consistent across comparisons, indicating that home advantage was clearly disrupted during the COVID-19 period. This league shows the most robust evidence for a pandemic-related effect on home performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **RFPL:**  \n",
    "No significant differences were observed, suggesting that home advantage in the Russian Premier League was not meaningfully affected during the COVID-19 period. This aligns with findings that this league exhibits less variability in home advantage across seasons.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Serie A:**  \n",
    "The lack of significant results for 2020 vs. 2015 and 2020 vs. 2016 suggests that the disruptions to home advantage in 2020 were not uniformly observed across all comparisons. Nevertheless, significant results for comparisons with other seasons (e.g., 2017–2019) indicate that the impact of the pandemic was still present, though less pronounced.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison with the One-Sided Test Results\n",
    "When compared to the original study that used one-sided tests, several differences emerge:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- For **Bundesliga**, the previously significant results for 2019 vs. 2014, 2019 vs. 2016, and 2019 vs. 2018 are now non-significant, weakening the evidence that the hybrid 2019 season disrupted home advantage. However, the significant results for 2020 remain, consistent with the original conclusion that COVID-19 impacted home advantage in that season.  \n",
    "- For **EPL**, the loss of significance for 2019 vs. 2014, 2020 vs. 2015, and 2020 vs. 2019 diminishes the strength of conclusions about disruptions to home advantage in 2019 and parts of 2020. This suggests that the evidence for a COVID-19 effect is less consistent under two-sided tests.  \n",
    "- In **La Liga**, the non-significant results for 2020 vs. 2015 and 2020 vs. 2019 reinforce the idea that home advantage was not disrupted, aligning with the original conclusions.  \n",
    "- For **Ligue 1** and **RFPL**, the results remain consistent with the one-sided tests, suggesting that the conclusions drawn in the original study are robust for these leagues.  \n",
    "- In **Serie A**, the new non-significant results for 2020 vs. 2015 and 2020 vs. 2016 suggest a reduced impact of COVID-19 on home advantage in those comparisons, though significant results for other seasons still support the presence of disruptions during the pandemic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The shift from one-sided to two-sided tests reveals that some previously identified effects might be more nuanced or less robust than initially thought.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion for another version of SciPy\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis highlights the sensitivity of the study’s conclusions to the choice of statistical method. The original study, which relied on one-sided tests, was more aligned with the directional hypothesis (a reduction in home advantage during COVID-19). The use of two-sided tests introduces additional scrutiny by testing for deviations in both directions, leading to differences in significance for some season comparisons.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the replicability of the study, this indicates:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency of Results:** The differences observed here suggest that conclusions about the impact of COVID-19 on home advantage may vary depending on the statistical approach used. While many findings remain consistent (e.g., Ligue 1, RFPL), the variability in other leagues (e.g., Bundesliga, EPL, Serie A) underscores the importance of methodological consistency for replicability.  \n",
    "- **Reevaluation of Findings:** The results from two-sided tests indicate that some effects initially observed might not be as robust as previously thought. This necessitates caution in generalizing findings and emphasizes the need for replication with different statistical methods to validate conclusions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while the original conclusions remain valid in many cases, the differences highlighted here demonstrate that methodological choices significantly influence outcomes. This methodological change highlights the importance of consistent statistical tools in longitudinal studies and underlines how updates to software packages can influence the replicability of results and conclusions. Care must be taken to adapt hypotheses and interpretations to the constraints imposed by the new testing methods."
